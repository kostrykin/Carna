/** \brief
  * Defines logic for rendering frames from given scenes.
  *
  * \section RenderingProcess Rendering Process
  *
  * The `%FrameRenderer` mainly defines a *sequence* of
  * \ref RenderStage "rendering stages". Each stage contributes several rendering
  * instructions to the overall rendering process. Such instructions can be the
  * rendering of 3D objects or also something completely different, like taking care
  * of stereoscopic rendering.
  *
  * The rendering process is made up by the execution of occasionally nested *render
  * tasks*. At the beginning of the process there is always exactly one render task.
  * It's purpose is to invoke the rendering stages of the frame renderer
  * successively. The render task API is documented \ref RenderTask "here".
  *
  * In the most simple case, there is only one render task all the time. An
  * invocation to \ref FrameRenderer::render triggers it's execution, which in turn
  * invokes rendering on each render stage once.
  *
  * However, there is an important concept about render tasks, that allows
  * realization of more complex rendering processes: Rendering stages may *fork* the
  * task they are invoked by. Such a forked task is basically a clone of the original
  * one: It continuous processing rendering stages with the next stage that it was
  * created by. It's purpose usually is to obtain a rendering from the succeeding
  * stages, store it to a texture and process this texture somehow afterwards. When
  * finished, the original task continuous with the same.
