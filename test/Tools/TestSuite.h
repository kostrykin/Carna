  *
  * \brief
  * This namespace contains the test suite components.
  *
  * \section TestSuite Test Suite
  *
  * The test suite is built upon QTestLib. It is integrated into CMake not via CTest
  * but as an executable. All files belonging to the test suite are listed within
  * <code>test/CMakeLists.txt</code>. For each class under test there is a test
  * class, that consists of a pair of header and implementation files. The CMake
  * project is set up to build a single executable for the whole test suite.
  *
  * When executed, the the test suite returns \c 0 if and only if all tests pass.
  *
  * \subsection TestSuite_TestTypes Unit Tests, Module Tests, Integration Tests
  *
  * Considering test types, the test suite currently differs among unit tests, module
  * tests and integration tests. For each test type there is a dedicated
  * <code>configure.cmake</code> file.
  *
  * This is where the test cases are specified:
  *
  *   - Unit tests are specified within <code>test/UnitTests/configure.cmake</code>.
  *   - Module tests are specified within
  *     <code>test/ModuleTests/configure.cmake</code>.
  *   - Integration tests are specified within
  *     <code>test/IntegrationTests/configure.cmake</code>.
  *
  * \subsection TestSuite_EnlistingTests Defining the Test Files
  *
  * In order to add a new test, simply choose the proper test type and modify the
  * corresponding `configure.cmake` file.
  *
  * Each consists of the sections below.
  *
  *   - The variable `TESTS` lists the class names of all test classes. If your class
  *     `MyClass` was tested by the test class named `MyClassTest`, you would have
  *     `MyClassTest` listed here.
  *   - The variable `TESTS_QOBJECT_HEADERS` lists the header files where the test
  *     classes are defined. QTestLib requires each test class to be derived from
  *     `QObject`.
  *   - If you had any additional header files that did not require the
  *     `Q_OBJECT` macro, they needed to be listed within `TESTS_HEADERS`.
  *   - `APPEND TESTS_SOURCES` lists the test classes implementation files.
  *
  * \subsection TestSuite_MiscellaneousFiles Miscellaneous Files
  *
  * There are two ways of specifying the test suite's additional files that do not
  * define any test classes. If these files are only required by a certain test type,
  * they should be enlisted within the `TESTS_QOBJECT_HEADERS` or `TESTS_HEADERS`
  * variable of the corresponding `configure.cmake` file, depending on whether they
  * do use the `Q_OBJECT` macro or not. The other option is to enlist them within the
  * `test/CMakeLists.txt` file, beneath the same variables. This way they become
  * available to each test type.
